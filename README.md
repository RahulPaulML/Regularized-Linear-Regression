# Regularized-Linear-Regression

In this project we predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir. Regularized Linear Regression is used for training the algorithm. 

The training set is divided into 3 different sets after random shuffle:
1. Training set
2. Cross validation set
3. Test set

This division was made so that the calculation of the regularization parameter (bias vs variance calculation) can be more efficiently done.

The code is written in Octave but can be run in both Octave and Matlab.
To run the code simply run the file ex5.m in Octave or Matlab.
